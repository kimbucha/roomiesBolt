# Profile Order Analysis: Why Jordan Smith Appears First

## 🔍 **Key Discovery: Your Swipe History Was Reset**

When you see **Jordan Smith** instead of **Jamie Rodriguez** at the top, it means your **swipe history was cleared**. Here's what happened:

### **🎯 Original Profile Order (mockDataSetup.ts)**
```
user1: Ethan Garcia (Stanford CS) 
user2: Jamie Rodriguez (UC Berkeley Architecture) ← Usually first unswiped
user3: Taylor Wilson (SFSU Business)
user4: Jordan Smith (UCSF Medicine) ← Now appearing first
user5: Morgan Lee (SJSU Engineering)
...and 6 more profiles
```

### **⚡ Why the Change Happened**

#### **Previous State (with swipes):**
- ✅ **user2 (Jamie Rodriguez)** - Already liked/disliked → **EXCLUDED**
- ✅ **user4 (Jordan Smith)** - Already liked/disliked → **EXCLUDED** 
- ✅ **user7 (Marcus Johnson)** - Already liked/disliked → **EXCLUDED**
- ✅ **user9 (Ethan Williams)** - Already liked/disliked → **EXCLUDED**
- ❌ **0 profiles remaining** → "Failed to load profiles" error

#### **Current State (swipes reset):**
- ✅ **user1 (Ethan Garcia)** - First in array, but filtered by preferences
- 🎯 **user4 (Jordan Smith)** - **First unswiped profile matching your filters**
- ✅ **user2 (Jamie Rodriguez)** - Back available but now second in filtered list

### **🔧 What Caused the Reset**

The swipe history was likely cleared by one of these actions:

1. **Manual Reset Button** - You may have used the "Reset Swipes" feature
2. **App Restart/Cache Clear** - Sometimes persistence fails on app restart
3. **Authentication Re-login** - Fresh login can reset local swipe state
4. **Development Reset** - Hot reload or Metro cache clear

### **🎛️ Filter Effects on Ordering**

Your **search filters** also affect which profile appears first:

```typescript
// From your current filters:
searchFilters.lookingFor = "roommates" // Excludes place-owners
// This means:
// - user1 (Ethan Garcia) has hasPlace=true → FILTERED OUT
// - user4 (Jordan Smith) has hasPlace=false → SHOWS FIRST ✅
// - user2 (Jamie Rodriguez) has hasPlace=false → SHOWS SECOND
```

### **🔄 Profile Filtering Logic**

The app uses this priority order:
1. **Type Filter** (`lookingFor: "roommates"` excludes place-owners)
2. **Swipe Exclusion** (removes already-swiped profiles)
3. **Array Order** (shows remaining profiles in mock data order)

**Result:** Jordan Smith (user4) is the first profile that:
- ✅ Matches "roommates" filter (hasPlace=false)
- ✅ Has NOT been swiped on (due to reset)
- ✅ Appears in mock data position #4

### **💡 To See Jamie Rodriguez First Again**

Change your filter to include both roommates and places:
- Go to **Filter settings**
- Change **"Looking for"** from **"Roommates"** to **"Both"**
- This will include user1 (Ethan Garcia) who would appear first as user2 (Jamie Rodriguez) second

Or keep current filter and swipe through profiles normally - Jamie Rodriguez will appear after Jordan Smith and other filtered profiles.
