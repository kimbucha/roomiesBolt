# Touch Crash Fix - React Native 0.76.9 (Simplified Solution)

## Problem Description

The app was experiencing crashes when users tried to paste text using the long-press context menu in TextInput fields.

### Error Details
```
*** Assertion failure in -[RCTSurfaceTouchHandler _updateTouches:]()
*** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInternalInconsistencyException', 
reason: 'Inconsistency between local and UIKit touch registries'
```

This is a known issue with React Native 0.76.9 where there's a mismatch between React Native's internal touch state and UIKit's touch state during paste operations.

## Root Cause

React Native 0.76.9's New Architecture has a touch handling bug where TextInput paste operations (long-press context menu) cause inconsistency between React Native's touch registry and UIKit's native touch handling.

## Simple Solution

**Just add two props to any TextInput where users might paste:**

```tsx
<TextInput
  // Your existing props...
  
  // RN 0.76.9 paste crash fix
  contextMenuHidden={false}
  selectTextOnFocus={false}
/>
```

That's it! These two props prevent the touch registry conflict.

## Why This Works

- `contextMenuHidden={false}` - Ensures the context menu (paste) is handled properly by iOS
- `selectTextOnFocus={false}` - Prevents automatic text selection that can conflict with touch handling

## Files Modified

- `app/(onboarding)/account.tsx` - Added the two props to all TextInput components
- `utils/textInputFix.ts` - Created a reusable props object (optional)

## Usage

### Direct approach (recommended):
```tsx
<TextInput
  placeholder="Enter your email"
  value={email}
  onChangeText={setEmail}
  // RN 0.76.9 paste crash fix
  contextMenuHidden={false}
  selectTextOnFocus={false}
/>
```

### Reusable props approach (optional):
```tsx
import { safeTextInputProps } from '../utils/textInputFix';

<TextInput
  {...safeTextInputProps}
  placeholder="Enter your email"
  value={email}
  onChangeText={setEmail}
/>
```

## Testing

1. Navigate to the account creation screen
2. Try to paste text using long-press in any text field
3. The app should no longer crash and paste should work normally

## Why This is Better

**Compared to complex solutions:**
- ✅ **Minimal**: Just 2 props, no wrappers or boundaries
- ✅ **Targeted**: Fixes the exact root cause
- ✅ **Maintainable**: Easy to understand and remove when RN fixes the bug
- ✅ **Performance**: No overhead, no extra components
- ✅ **Debuggable**: No layers hiding the actual issue

## Future Considerations

Remove these props when:
1. React Native releases a fix for the touch handling issue
2. The app upgrades to a version that resolves the problem

This is a temporary workaround for a specific RN 0.76.9 bug.
