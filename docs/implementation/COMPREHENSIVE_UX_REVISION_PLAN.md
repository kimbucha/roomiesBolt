# Comprehensive UX Revision Plan for Roommate Profiling & Place Listing

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive revision of the Roomies app's onboarding flows and filter systems based on UX best practices, user psychology, and modern app design patterns. The current system has strong foundations but needs refinement for optimal user experience and data collection efficiency.

## Current State Analysis
