# Potato Profile Picture for Place Listers - Photos Page Fix

## Problem Identified

When place listers reached the photos onboarding page without having completed the personality quiz, the app was showing a personality-based default avatar instead of a potato image. This was inconsistent with the user journey since place listers access photos through place listing onboarding, not through the full personality-based onboarding flow.

## Solution Implemented

### **Logic Changes in `app/(onboarding)/photos.tsx`:**

1. **Import potato image:**
   ```tsx
   const potatoImage = require('../../assets/images/potato.png');
   ```

2. **Add potato state:**
   ```tsx
   const [showPotatoDefault, setShowPotatoDefault] = useState(false);
   ```

3. **Role-based default logic:**
   ```tsx
   // For place listers who accessed photos via place listing onboarding,
   // they should get a potato image instead of personality
   if (user?.userRole === 'place_lister') {
     console.log('[Photos] Place lister without personality type - using potato default');
     setShowPotatoDefault(true);
     // Don't redirect, let them continue with potato as default
   } else {
     // For regular roommate seekers, redirect to the personality quiz
     router.replace('/(onboarding)/personality/quiz');
   }
   ```

4. **Updated form readiness check:**
   ```tsx
   const hasValidPhoto = photos.length > 0 || 
                        (hasPersonalityImage && personalityImage !== null) ||
                        showPotatoDefault;
   ```

5. **Visual potato display:**
   ```tsx
   {/* Potato Default Image - Show for place listers without personality type */}
   {showPotatoDefault && !personalityImage && (
     <View style={[styles.photoContainer, styles.personalityContainer]}>
       <Image source={potatoImage} style={[styles.personalityImage, styles.defaultProfilePhoto]} />
       <View style={styles.profileBadge}>
         <Text style={styles.profileBadgeText}>Profile</Text>
       </View>
     </View>
   )}
   ```

6. **Profile picture index handling:**
   - **-1**: Personality image
   - **-2**: Potato default (NEW)
   - **0+**: User uploaded photos

7. **Database storage handling:**
   ```tsx
   } else if (profilePhotoIndex === -2) {
     // User has potato default as profile picture
     profilePictureIdentifier = ProfileImageService.getDatabaseIdentifier({
       type: ProfileImageType.POTATO_DEFAULT,
       source: null
     });
   ```

## User Flow Impact

### **Before (Broken):**
1. Place lister goes through place listing onboarding
2. Reaches photos page
3. Gets redirected to personality quiz (wrong!)
4. OR shows personality avatar they never earned

### **After (Fixed):**
1. Place lister goes through place listing onboarding
2. Reaches photos page
3. Sees potato image as default profile picture âœ“
4. Can upload additional photos if desired
5. Continues with potato as their profile picture
6. Consistent with "skipped onboarding" users

## Technical Benefits

- **Role-aware defaults**: Different behavior for different user journeys
- **Consistent branding**: Potato = "basic/default" user across the app
- **No forced redirects**: Place listers aren't forced into personality quiz
- **Visual clarity**: Easy to identify users who haven't done personality assessment
- **Maintains data integrity**: Proper ProfileImageService integration

## Key Files Modified

1. **`app/(onboarding)/photos.tsx`**
   - Added potato import and state management
   - Added role-based logic for default profile picture
   - Updated form validation and visual display
   - Enhanced profile picture index handling

The solution ensures place listers get a proper default experience that matches their simplified onboarding journey, while maintaining the full personality-based experience for regular roommate seekers.
