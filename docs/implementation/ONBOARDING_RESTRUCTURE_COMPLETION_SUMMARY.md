- ✅ Added helper functions for dynamic flow selection
- ✅ Updated step numbers and navigation routing

### 2. Goals Page Restructured
- ✅ Made Goals step 2 (first real onboarding step after welcome)

  - Place lister ("find-roommates") → `place-details`
  - Others → `budget` (standard flow)
- ✅ Fixed step numbers and progress indicators

### 3. Navigation Flow Updated
- ✅ Updated `welcome.tsx` to navigate to `goals` instead of `account`
- ✅ Updated `goals.tsx` with new branching logic
- ✅ Updated `place-details.tsx` to navigate to `photos` when complete
- ✅ Updated all navigation paths for new flow

### 4. About You Page Reordered
- ✅ Moved from step 5 to after lifestyle (step 5 in room seeker flow)
- ✅ Updated `lifestyle.tsx` to navigate to `about-you`
- ✅ Updated `about-you.tsx` to navigate to `personality/intro`

### 5. Social Proof Removed
- ✅ Removed `social-proof` from onboarding layout
- ✅ Updated `photos.tsx` to navigate directly to `notifications`
- ✅ Eliminated social-proof step completely

### 6. Step Numbers and Progress Updated
- ✅ Updated all onboarding pages with correct step numbers
- ✅ Made step numbers dynamic based on user role
- ✅ Fixed progress indicators throughout both flows
- ✅ Updated total step counts dynamically

### 7. Layout and Route Definitions Updated
- ✅ Removed `social-proof` from `app/(onboarding)/_layout.tsx`
- ✅ All routes properly defined and working

## Key Technical Improvements

### Dynamic Step Calculation
```typescript
// Place listers: step 4 of 5, Room seekers: step 8 of 9
const userRole = user?.userRole;
const isPlaceLister = userRole === 'place_lister';
const totalSteps = isPlaceLister ? 5 : 9;
const currentStepIndex = isPlaceLister ? 4 : 8;
```

### Branching Navigation Logic
```typescript
if (selectedGoal === 'find-roommates') {
  // User has a place and wants roommates → Place Lister Flow
  userRole = 'place_lister';
  nextScreen = 'place-details';
} else {
  // User is looking for a room or roommates → Standard Room Seeker Flow  
  userRole = selectedGoal === 'find-room' ? 'roommate_seeker' : 'both';
  nextScreen = 'budget'; // Standard flow starts with budget
}
```

### Configuration Structure
- **Place Lister Flow**: 5 steps total (welcome → goals → place-details → photos → notifications)
- **Room Seeker Flow**: 9 steps total (welcome → goals → budget → lifestyle → about-you → personality → education → photos → notifications)

## ✅ Testing Status

- ✅ Place Lister Flow: Welcome → Goals → Place Details → Photos → Notifications → Home
- ✅ Room Seeker Flow: Welcome → Goals → Budget → Lifestyle → About You → Personality → Education → Photos → Notifications → Home
- ✅ Step numbers display correctly in both flows
- ✅ Navigation works in both directions (forward/back)
- ✅ Progress indicators show correct step counts
- ✅ User role routing works correctly
- ✅ Social proof page completely removed

## Files Modified

1. `store/onboardingConfig.ts` - New branching flow configuration
2. `app/(onboarding)/welcome.tsx` - Navigate to goals instead of account  
3. `app/(onboarding)/goals.tsx` - Step 2, branching navigation logic
4. `app/(onboarding)/budget.tsx` - Step 3, updated navigation
5. `app/(onboarding)/lifestyle.tsx` - Step 4, navigate to about-you
6. `app/(onboarding)/about-you.tsx` - Step 5, navigate to personality

9. `app/(onboarding)/notifications.tsx` - Dynamic steps, complete onboarding
10. `app/(onboarding)/_layout.tsx` - Removed social-proof route

## UX Benefits Achieved

1. **Faster Path for Place Listers**: Only 5 steps vs 9 steps
2. **Better User Context**: Goals first determines appropriate flow
3. **Logical Flow Order**: About You before personality quiz for better context
4. **Reduced Friction**: Eliminated unnecessary social proof step
5. **Clear Progress**: Accurate step counts for each user type
6. **Intuitive Navigation**: Users see relevant steps only
