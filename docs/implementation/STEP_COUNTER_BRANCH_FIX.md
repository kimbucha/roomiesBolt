# Step Counter Branch Fix - Summary

## ✅ FIXED: Step Counters Now Restart for Each Branch

The step counters have been updated to restart counting from 1 for each branch after the Goals selection, providing accurate progress indication for users.

## New Step Counter Logic

### Universal Start (No Step Counter)
- Welcome, Account, Get-Started, Goals = **No step counter shown**
- Goals page hides step counter since we don't know which path yet

### After Goals Selection - Step Counters Restart at 1

#### Room Seeker Branch (7 steps total)
1. **Budget**: Step 1 of 7
2. **Lifestyle**: Step 2 of 7  
3. **About You**: Step 3 of 7
4. **Personality**: Step 4 of 7
5. **Education**: Step 5 of 7
6. **Photos**: Step 6 of 7
7. **Notifications**: Step 7 of 7

#### Place Lister Branch (3 steps total)
1. **Place Details**: Step 1 of 3
2. **Photos**: Step 2 of 3
3. **Notifications**: Step 3 of 3

## Files Updated

✅ **app/(onboarding)/goals.tsx** - Hidden step counter with `hideProgress={true}`
✅ **app/(onboarding)/budget.tsx** - Step 1 of 7 (was 5 of 11)
✅ **app/(onboarding)/lifestyle.tsx** - Step 2 of 7 (was 6 of 11)
✅ **app/(onboarding)/about-you.tsx** - Step 3 of 7 (was 7 of 11)
✅ **app/(onboarding)/personality/intro.tsx** - Step 4 of 7 (was using old config)
✅ **app/(onboarding)/education.tsx** - Step 5 of 7 (was using old config)
✅ **app/(onboarding)/place-details.tsx** - Step 1 of 3 (was 5 of 7)
✅ **app/(onboarding)/photos.tsx** - Dynamic: Step 6 of 7 OR Step 2 of 3
✅ **app/(onboarding)/notifications.tsx** - Dynamic: Step 7 of 7 OR Step 3 of 3

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Accurate Progress**: Users see correct step counts for their chosen path
2. **Clear Context**: Step counters restart for each branch, making progress intuitive
3. **No Confusion**: Goals page doesn't show misleading step count
4. **Shorter Perceived Length**: Place listers see "1 of 3" instead of "5 of 7"
5. **Logical Flow**: Each branch feels like a complete, focused journey

## Before vs After

### Before (Incorrect)
- Goals: "Step 4 of 11" ❌
- Budget: "Step 5 of 11" ❌  
- Place Details: "Step 5 of 7" ❌

### After (Correct)
- Goals: No step counter ✅
- Budget: "Step 1 of 7" ✅
- Place Details: "Step 1 of 3" ✅

This fix provides a much cleaner and more intuitive user experience where each path feels like its own focused journey rather than a continuation of a longer universal flow.
