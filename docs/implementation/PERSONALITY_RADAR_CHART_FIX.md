# Personality Radar Chart Fix - Store Synchronization Issue

## Issue Description

The personality radar chart in the discover detail sheet was showing the same hexagonal shape (default values) for all users, regardless of their actual personality test answers during onboarding.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was a **store mismatch** in the data flow:

1. **Onboarding Personality Quiz** (`app/(onboarding)/personality/quiz.tsx`) was saving personality data to `useUserStore` (the legacy store)
2. **Radar Chart Component** (`components/roommate/PersonalityDetailSection.tsx`) was reading personality data from `useSupabaseUserStore` (the current store)

This created a data flow break:
```
Onboarding Quiz → useUserStore (saves data)
                       ↕ (DATA NEVER SYNCED)  
Radar Chart    ← useSupabaseUserStore (reads data) ← Falls back to defaults
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `app/(onboarding)/personality/quiz.tsx`

**Changes Made:**
- Added import for `useSupabaseUserStore`
- Added hook to access Supabase store's `updateUserAndProfile` method
- Changed personality data saving from regular store to Supabase store
- Made `handleContinue` function async to handle await calls
- Updated verification logging to check Supabase store instead of regular store

**Key Fix:**
```typescript
// OLD (incorrect):
const result = updateUserAndProfile(personalityData, { validate: true });

// NEW (correct):
const result = await updateSupabaseUserAndProfile(personalityData, { validate: true });
```

## Data Flow After Fix

```
Onboarding Quiz → useSupabaseUserStore (saves data)
                       ↕ (DATA SYNCED)  
Radar Chart    ← useSupabaseUserStore (reads data) ← Gets real personality data
```

## Testing Verification

After this fix, users should see:

1. **Personality quiz completion** saves data to Supabase database with proper persistence
2. **Radar chart display** shows actual user personality dimensions instead of default hexagon
3. **Different personality types** result in different radar chart shapes
4. **Console logs** confirm data is being saved to and read from the same store

## Personality Dimension Mapping

The radar chart maps MBTI dimensions to visual elements:

- **Social Energy** → `dims.ei` (Extraversion/Introversion)
- **Daily Routine** → `dims.jp` (Judging/Perceiving) 
- **Communication** → `dims.tf` (Thinking/Feeling)
- **Planning Style** → `100 - dims.jp` (Inverted J/P)
- **Decision Style** → `dims.tf` (Thinking/Feeling)
- **Lifestyle** → `dims.sn` (Sensing/Intuition)

## Expected Results

- ✅ Unique radar chart shapes for different personalities
- ✅ Real user data instead of fallback defaults  
- ✅ Consistent data flow throughout the app
- ✅ Proper database persistence via Supabase

## Fallback Behavior

The radar chart component has smart fallbacks in `PersonalityDetailSection.tsx`:

```typescript
const currentUserDimensions = user?.personalityDimensions || {
  // ISTP "The Craftsman" dimensions - practical, logical, hands-on
  ei: 75, // Introverted (I) - higher values = more introverted
  sn: 25, // Sensing (S) - lower values = more sensing/practical  
  tf: 20, // Thinking (T) - lower values = more thinking/logical
  jp: 75  // Perceiving (P) - higher values = more flexible/adaptable
};
```

If no personality data exists, it falls back to ISTP personality type dimensions.

## Solution for Existing Users

For **existing accounts** that completed personality quiz before the fix:

### Option 1: Automatic Fallback (Implemented)
The radar chart component now has smart fallback logic that reads from both stores:
1. **Priority 1:** Supabase store (new/migrated users)  
2. **Priority 2:** Legacy store (existing users)
3. **Priority 3:** ISTP defaults (fallback)

### Option 2: One-Time Migration (Available)
Go to **Debug Menu** → **"Fix Personality Radar Charts"** to manually migrate your personality data from the legacy store to Supabase store.

**Path:** `app/(debug)/index.tsx` → "Fix Personality Radar Charts" button

## Testing Instructions

### For New Accounts:
1. Create account and complete onboarding with personality quiz
2. Visit discover section and view profile details
3. Radar chart should show your actual personality dimensions

### For Existing Accounts:
1. **Option A:** Radar chart should automatically work with fallback logic
2. **Option B:** Use debug migration button for permanent fix

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

**New Users:** ✅ Fixed - personality data saves to correct store  
**Existing Users:** ✅ Fixed - automatic fallback + optional migration

This fix resolves the core issue where personality test results from onboarding weren't appearing in the discovery radar charts.
