# Messaging System Fixes - December 2024

## Issues Fixed

### 1. UUID Format Error ✅
**Problem**: Conversation IDs were using timestamp format `conv-1750421157168` instead of proper UUIDs
**Solution**: 
- Updated `ConversationRepository.ts` to generate proper UUID format using crypto-style UUID generation
- Changed from `id: \`conv-${Date.now()}\`` to `id: generateUUID()`

### 2. Roommate Store Access Error ✅  
**Problem**: Error accessing `availableRoommates` property that was undefined
**Solution**:
- Added proper null checks in `ConversationRepository.ts`
- Check if `roommateStore.availableRoommates` exists and is array before accessing
- Added fallback profile data for Jamie Rodriguez

### 3. Match Card Not Disappearing ✅
**Problem**: Match cards remained in "New Matches" section even after conversations were created and messages sent
**Solution**:
- Enhanced conversation detection in `app/(tabs)/matches/index.tsx`
- Added messaging store integration to match filtering logic
- Check both conversations store AND messaging store for conversation existence
- Enhanced message checking to include messaging store messages
- Updated filtering logic to properly remove matches when conversations have messages

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified:
1. `repositories/ConversationRepository.ts` - UUID generation & roommate store access
2. `app/(tabs)/matches/index.tsx` - Enhanced filtering logic & messaging store integration

### Key Changes:
- Proper UUID generation for conversation IDs
- Defensive programming for roommate store access
- Integration between matches screen and messaging store
- Reactive updates when messaging store changes
- Enhanced conversation and message detection

## Expected Behavior
- When user taps match card → navigates to conversation
- When user sends first message → conversation created with proper UUID
- Match card disappears from "New Matches" section  
- Conversation appears in "Messages" section
- No more UUID errors in message creation
- No more roommate store access errors

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED
All identified issues have been resolved. The messaging system should now work as intended with proper match card lifecycle management.
