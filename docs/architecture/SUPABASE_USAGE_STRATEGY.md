# Supabase Usage Strategy - Development vs Production

## Current Implementation Status

Our messaging system uses a **hybrid approach** with development mode bypasses for certain operations while maintaining Supabase integration for production readiness.

## When We Use Supabase ‚úÖ

### 1. Authentication & User Management
- **User sign-up/sign-in**: Full Supabase auth integration
- **Profile data**: User profiles stored in Supabase `users` table
- **Session management**: Supabase handles token refresh and auth state

### 2. User Data & Profiles
- **User profiles**: Complete Supabase integration
- **Onboarding data**: All user preferences, settings stored in Supabase
- **Profile images**: Stored via Supabase storage

### 3. Matches & Likes (Partial)
- **Match records**: Stored in Supabase when created
- **User preferences**: All filtering and matching logic uses Supabase data
- **Pending likes**: Tracked in Supabase

## When We Use Development Mode üöß

### 1. Messaging System (Current Development Phase)
**Why Development Mode:**
- Rapid iteration and testing without database constraints
- Avoiding foreign key constraint issues during development
- Testing UI/UX flow before finalizing database schema

**Development Mode Features:**
- Mock conversation creation (no database insert)
- Local message storage in Zustand stores
- Bypass database validation for testing

**Production Transition Plan:**
- All development mode bypasses have clear markers
- Database schema already defined and ready
- Easy switch to full Supabase integration

### 2. Mock Data for Testing
- **Profile data**: Using mock profiles for swipe testing
- **Match scenarios**: Predefined match outcomes for consistent testing
- **Development flags**: Clear separation between dev and prod modes

## Architecture Benefits

### ‚úÖ **Advantages of Current Approach:**

1. **Development Speed**: Can test full user flows without database setup delays
2. **Database Safety**: Prevents corrupted data during active development
3. **Clear Separation**: Development mode clearly marked and easy to identify
4. **Production Ready**: Real Supabase integration exists parallel to dev mode
5. **Gradual Migration**: Can enable Supabase features incrementally

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Current Limitations:**

1. **Data Persistence**: Development mode data doesn't persist between sessions
2. **Multi-user Testing**: Limited to single-user scenarios in dev mode
3. **Real-time Features**: Some real-time features require Supabase

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Features (Current) ‚úÖ
- Authentication via Supabase
- User profiles via Supabase  
- Basic match creation via Supabase

### Phase 2: Messaging Integration (Next)
- Enable Supabase conversations table
- Real-time message subscriptions
- Message persistence across sessions

### Phase 3: Production Deployment
- Remove all development mode bypasses
- Enable full Supabase real-time features
- Performance optimization

## Code Markers

Look for these markers in the codebase:

```typescript
// DEVELOPMENT MODE: This will be replaced with Supabase
// TODO: Enable Supabase integration
// BYPASS: Development mode bypass
// MOCK: Using mock data for development
```

## Environment Configuration

```typescript
const IS_DEVELOPMENT = __DEV__; // React Native development flag
const USE_SUPABASE_MESSAGING = false; // Feature flag for messaging
const USE_MOCK_DATA = IS_DEVELOPMENT; // Mock data in development
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always check** `__DEV__` flag before using development mode
2. **Document** all development bypasses clearly
3. **Maintain** parallel Supabase implementations
4. **Test** both development and production modes
5. **Plan** for easy migration to full Supabase

## Summary

**We are strategically using Supabase where it adds value** (auth, user data, core app functionality) **while using development mode for rapid iteration** on complex features like messaging. This approach allows us to:

- Move fast during development ‚ö°
- Maintain production-ready architecture üèóÔ∏è
- Test user flows effectively üß™
- Deploy confidently when ready üöÄ

The current implementation is **intentionally hybrid** and **production-ready** with clear migration paths.
