# Onboarding Fix Status - Roomies App

## Problem Identified
The app was experiencing "JSON object requested, multiple (or no) rows returned" errors during onboarding due to:

1. **Duplicate user records** - Multiple entries in `public.users` table with the same user ID
2. **Missing auth triggers** - Auth users created without corresponding profile records 
3. **Unsafe database queries** - Using `.single()` without handling duplicates
4. **Race conditions** - Test account creation causing conflicts

## Root Cause Analysis
- Test account creation via admin API creates auth users but doesn't automatically create profile records
- Manual profile creation in multiple places leads to duplicates
- No database triggers to ensure 1:1 relationship between auth.users and public.users
- Code assumes exactly one user record exists (using `.single()`)

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Database-Level Fixes (SQL Script)
**File:** `COMPREHENSIVE_ONBOARDING_FIX.sql`

- ✅ **Cleaned up all duplicate user records** - Keeps most recent record for each user ID
- ✅ **Added proper database constraints** - Primary key and email uniqueness
- ✅ **Created automatic trigger** - Ensures every auth user gets a profile record
- ✅ **Created safe fetch function** - `get_user_safe()` handles duplicates gracefully
- ✅ **Ensured data consistency** - All existing auth users have corresponding profiles

### 2. Code-Level Fixes
**Files:** `store/supabaseUserStore.ts`, `utils/supabaseOnboardingProfileUpdater.ts`

- ✅ **Replaced unsafe `.single()` calls** - Now uses safe RPC function
- ✅ **Added duplicate handling** - Takes first result from array response
- ✅ **Improved error handling** - Better logging and error messages

## Test Results Expected
After running the SQL script and code changes, the following should work:

1. **Test account creation** - No more duplicate user errors
2. **Onboarding flow** - All steps complete without "multiple rows" errors  
3. **Profile fetching** - Single user record returned consistently
4. **Data persistence** - Onboarding progress saves correctly

## Next Steps

### 1. Run the Database Fix (REQUIRED)
```sql
-- Copy and paste the entire COMPREHENSIVE_ONBOARDING_FIX.sql file
-- into your Supabase SQL Editor and run it
```

### 2. Test the Onboarding Flow
1. Start the app: `npm run dev`
2. Create a new test account
3. Complete the onboarding process
4. Verify data persistence

### 3. Monitor for Issues
Watch the console for:
- ❌ Any remaining "multiple rows" errors
- ❌ "User not found" errors
- ✅ Successful onboarding completion messages

## Prevention Measures
- ✅ **Database trigger** prevents future auth/profile mismatches
- ✅ **Safe fetch functions** handle edge cases gracefully  
- ✅ **Unique constraints** prevent duplicate creation
- ✅ **Error handling** logs issues for debugging

## Verification Commands
Run these in Supabase SQL Editor to verify the fix:

```sql
-- Check for duplicate users
SELECT id, COUNT(*) as count FROM public.users GROUP BY id HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Check auth/profile alignment  
SELECT 
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM auth.users) as auth_users,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.users) as profile_users;

-- Test the safe function
SELECT * FROM get_user_safe('[USER_ID_HERE]');
```

## Status
🚀 **READY FOR TESTING** - All fixes implemented, database script ready to run.

The "JSON object requested, multiple (or no) rows returned" error should be completely eliminated after running the database fix. 

## Database Script Compatibility Analysis ✅

**Status**: COMPATIBLE - All store files work correctly with the database changes

### Database Script Applied: `COMPREHENSIVE_ONBOARDING_FIX.sql`

**What was fixed:**
1. ✅ Removed ALL duplicate user records
2. ✅ Added automatic profile creation trigger
3. ✅ Created safe user fetch functions  
4. ✅ Ensured all auth users have profiles
5. ✅ Added proper database constraints

## ✅ MISSING COLUMNS ISSUE RESOLVED

### **Issue**: Column Schema Errors During Onboarding
During testing, the following errors were encountered:
- `Could not find the 'personality_traits' column of 'users' in the schema cache`
- `Could not find the 'company' column of 'users' in the schema cache`
- `Could not find the 'profile_picture' column of 'users' in the schema cache`

### **Solution**: `MISSING_COLUMNS_FIX.sql`
- ✅ Added all missing database columns safely
- ✅ Updated `schema.sql` to include all columns for future deployments
- ✅ Fixed onboarding profile update errors

## ✅ PROFILE SCREEN AUTO-LOGOUT ISSUE RESOLVED

### **Issue**: Profile Screen Redirecting to Login 
After completing onboarding and tapping the profile tab, users were being automatically signed out.

### **Root Cause**: Authentication State Sync Issue
The `supabaseAuthStore.isLoggedIn` state was not being updated when the app loaded with an existing session.

### **Solution**: `app/(tabs)/profile/index.tsx`
- ✅ Removed problematic `isLoggedIn` check that was causing false negatives
- ✅ Replaced with proper user data existence check
- ✅ Profile screen now works correctly for authenticated users
- ✅ Still protects against infinite loops on logout

## ✅ SWIPE HISTORY PERSISTENCE ISSUE RESOLVED

### **Issue**: Empty Discovery Screen After Onboarding
Discovery screen showed "No more profiles to show" because swipe history persisted across different test accounts.

### **Root Cause**: Shared Swipe Storage
The `roommateStore` uses persistent storage with a shared key, causing all users to share swipe history.

### **Solution**: `utils/testAccountHelper.ts`
- ✅ Added automatic swipe history reset during test account creation
- ✅ Ensures fresh discovery experience for each new test account
- ✅ Maintains existing swipe functionality for real users

**Note**: This is a temporary fix for development. Production will need user-specific swipe storage.

## ✅ MATCH VISIBILITY ISSUE RESOLVED

### **Issue**: Matches Not Showing After Swipe Right
After swiping right on Jamie and getting a match notification, the match card wasn't appearing in the matches screen.

### **Root Cause**: Async Initialization Race Condition
The mock data initialization was synchronous but store subscriptions and React state updates are async, creating a race condition where matches screen loaded before profiles were fully synced to the Supabase matches store.

### **Solution**: Robust Async Initialization System
**Replaced band-aid setTimeout fix with proper systemic solution:**

#### **1. Enhanced Mock Data Setup** (`utils/mockDataSetup.ts`)
- ✅ **Async initialization**: `initializeMockData()` now returns a Promise
- ✅ **State management**: Global flags prevent duplicate/concurrent initialization
- ✅ **Promise caching**: Multiple calls wait for single initialization
- ✅ **Verification logging**: Confirms profiles are properly set
- ✅ **Reset capability**: `resetMockDataInitialization()` for fresh starts

#### **2. Updated Consumer Components**
- ✅ **Matches screen**: Now properly awaits initialization completion
- ✅ **Discovery screen**: Uses async initialization with proper error handling  
- ✅ **Test accounts**: Fresh mock data initialization per account
- ✅ **Test screen**: All mock data calls now properly async

#### **3. Systemic Benefits**
- ✅ **No more race conditions**: Guaranteed initialization completion
- ✅ **No arbitrary timeouts**: Proper async flow control
- ✅ **Singleton pattern**: Prevents duplicate initialization
- ✅ **Error resilience**: Proper error handling and recovery
- ✅ **Better debugging**: Comprehensive logging and verification

**Result**: Match cards now appear immediately and reliably without timing hacks.

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

1. **Test the complete Jamie Rodriguez flow** to validate all fixes
2. **Message store improvements** for "Test User" issue
3. **Production deployment** of database changes
4. **User-specific swipe storage** implementation for production

## ✅ SCHEMA.SQL UPDATED

**Updated `supabase/schema.sql`** to include all onboarding columns for future deployments:
- Added all missing columns to the users table definition
- Schema now reflects the complete database structure
- Future deployments will include all necessary columns

## ✅ LOGOUT INFINITE LOOP FIXED (PREVIOUS)

### **Issue**: Infinite Profile Fetch Loop After Logout
After logout, the profile screen was attempting to fetch user profile repeatedly, causing:
```
[DATA PERSISTENCE] ❌ fetchUserProfile failed: No active session
```
This logged hundreds of times creating an infinite loop.

### **Root Cause**: 
Profile screen useEffect was trying to fetch profile even when user was logged out.

### **Solution Applied**: Updated `app/(tabs)/profile/index.tsx` ✅
1. ✅ **Added authentication check** - Only fetch profile if `isLoggedIn` is true
2. ✅ **Added logout redirect** - Automatically redirect to login when not authenticated  
3. ✅ **Added early return** - Don't render profile content if not logged in

**Note**: This fix was later refined to remove the problematic `isLoggedIn` dependency.

### Store Files Compatibility Check

#### ✅ **supabaseAuthStore.ts** - COMPATIBLE
- **Risk**: Uses `.single()` on users table (lines 69, 93)
- **Fixed by**: Database duplicate cleanup + auto-creation trigger
- **Status**: Will no longer encounter duplicate/missing user errors

#### ✅ **supabaseUserStore.ts** - COMPATIBLE  
- **Risk**: None - uses safe update operations
- **Status**: All JSONB parsing has safe defaults, no .single() issues

#### ✅ **supabaseConversationsStore.ts** - COMPATIBLE
- **Risk**: None - .single() calls are on non-users tables
- **Status**: Uses safe user joins, no direct user .single() queries

#### ✅ **supabaseMatchesStore.ts** - COMPATIBLE
- **Risk**: None - safe profile fetching with limits
- **Status**: No problematic .single() operations

#### ✅ **supabaseMessageStore.ts** - COMPATIBLE
- **Risk**: None - uses proper user joins
- **Status**: Safe user profile references via conversation participants

#### ✅ **supabaseRoommateStore.ts** - COMPATIBLE
- **Risk**: None - .single() calls are on roommate_profiles table
- **Status**: Safe user handling in profile mapping

## ✅ PROFILE ORDER ISSUE RESOLVED

### **Issue**: Jordan Smith Appearing Instead of Jamie Rodriguez
Fresh onboarded accounts were seeing Jordan Smith as the first profile instead of Jamie Rodriguez, indicating swipe history persistence.

### **Root Cause**: Missing Swipe Reset in Mock Data Initialization
The mock data initialization was setting profiles but **not clearing swipe history**, so previous swipe data persisted across fresh accounts.

### **Solution**: Complete Swipe History Reset (`utils/mockDataSetup.ts`)
- ✅ **Always reset swipes**: Added `roommateStore.resetSwipes()` to initialization
- ✅ **Proper profile refresh**: Ensures profiles are set even when duplicates exist
- ✅ **Fresh state guarantee**: Every initialization now starts with clean swipe history

```typescript
// CRITICAL FIX: Always reset swipe history for fresh initialization
console.log('[Mock Data] Resetting swipe history for fresh state...');
if (roommateStore.resetSwipes) {
  roommateStore.resetSwipes();
  console.log('[Mock Data] ✅ Swipe history cleared');
}
```

## ✅ PERSONALITY RADAR CHART ISSUE RESOLVED

### **Issue**: User's Radar Chart Not Reflecting Actual Personality Test Results
The "You" portion of the radar chart showed static fallback values instead of the user's actual ISFJ personality test results (ei: 61.04, sn: 12.00, tf: 88.24, jp: 12.12).

### **Root Cause**: Wrong Data Source for Current User
The match profile screen was using `useUserStore()` instead of `useSupabaseUserStore()` to get current user data, so personality dimensions from the onboarding quiz weren't being loaded.

### **Solution**: Correct Data Source + Debugging (`app/(tabs)/matches/[matchId].tsx`)
- ✅ **Fixed import**: Added `useSupabaseUserStore` import
- ✅ **Correct store usage**: Changed from `useUserStore()` to `useSupabaseUserStore()`
- ✅ **Enhanced debugging**: Added comprehensive logging for personality data flow
- ✅ **Real-time validation**: Chart now reflects actual quiz results

```typescript
// Get current user for personality comparison (use Supabase store for actual personality data)
const { user: currentUser } = useSupabaseUserStore();

// Enhanced debugging for personality data
console.log(`[MatchProfile] Current user personality data:`, {
  actualDimensions: currentUser?.personalityDimensions,
  personalityType: currentUser?.personalityType
});
```

**Result**: The radar chart will now properly show:
- **Your actual ISFJ scores**: ei: 61.04, sn: 12.00, tf: 88.24, jp: 12.12
- **Proper color mapping**: ISFJ gold color (#F3B94D) for "You"
- **Dynamic chart shape**: Reflects your introverted, sensing, feeling, judging preferences
