# Console Spam Cleanup Summary

## Issue Fixed
Removed excessive console.log statements that were spamming the console during drag interactions with the profile detail sheet, particularly when viewing personality compatibility information.

## Files Modified

### 1. `components/roommate/PersonalityDetailSection.tsx`
**Lines affected:** 178-181
**Changes:** Removed debug logging for user data, personality type, and dimensions that was triggering on every render during drag interactions.

### 2. `components/roommate/CompatibilityRadarChart.tsx`
**Lines affected:** 204, 211, 564
**Changes:** 
- Removed `[USER COLOR]` console logs that fired repeatedly when calculating personality colors
- Removed `[COMPATIBILITY]` logs that spammed for each compatibility dimension calculation

### 3. `components/DetailCard/hooks/useGestureHandler.ts`
**Lines affected:** Multiple locations
**Changes:**
- Reduced verbose logging in `onPanResponderGrant` (gesture start)
- Removed detailed movement logging in `onPanResponderMove` 
- Simplified release logging in `onPanResponderRelease` to only log significant movements (>20px)
- Removed debug logger entries that were adding excessive log history
- Kept only essential error logging for dismissal conflicts

### 4. `components/DetailCard/utils/animationUtils.ts`
**Lines affected:** 18, 38
**Changes:** Removed animation start and completion logging that spammed during dismissal animations

### 5. `components/DetailCard/utils/gestureUtils.ts`
**Lines affected:** 36, 49, 56, 62, 71, 78, 101, 111, 121, 128
**Changes:**
- Reduced logging frequency in `shouldDismissSwipe` to only log significant movements (>50px)

- Removed individual condition logging that was cluttering the console

### 6. `store/roommateStore.ts`

### 7. `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`
**Lines affected:** 1140, 1145
**Changes:** Removed card rendering logs that spammed during profile stack updates

## Impact
- **Before:** Console was flooded with logs during every drag interaction, making debugging difficult
- **After:** Console is clean during normal interactions, with only essential error/warning logs remaining
- **Preserved:** Important error logging and warnings for debugging actual issues

## Retained Logging
The following logging was intentionally kept:
- Error warnings for invalid profile data
- Dismissal conflict warnings
- Essential gesture detection for significant movements only
- Fast swipe detection logging (only when actually dismissing)

## Performance Benefits
- Reduced console overhead during drag interactions
- Cleaner debug experience for developers
- Maintained functionality while eliminating noise
